#CppND-Capstone-Sudoko Solver

This project aims at developing a Sudoko solver using C++ and the OpenCV library. 

Initially, it will detect and solve puzzles from a static image and later on try to extend the project for real-time solution using a video stream.

The project is structured as follows:

... 

The project aims to cover the concepts taught as a part of the C++ Nanodegree.
